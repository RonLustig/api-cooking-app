-----------------------------Setting up the database from TheMealDB-----------------------------

1. Make sure your git is up to date with my stuff on the sprint 1 branch, so 
    git pull origin sprint1

2.1 The script relys on 'requests' to be downloaded. I added the 'requests' stuff into the requirements.txt now, 
but you can check in your terminal with:
    pip show requests


2.1 If it turns out you do not have it installed, run:
    pip install requests



3. You should be good to try running the custom script to populate the database. The script I made 
is in cookapp/management/commands/fetch_meals. Run the following:
    python manage.py fetch_meals
